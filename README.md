# News-Sentiment-Analysis-on-Stock-Prices

Executive Summary

- Stock Prices are often used as an important indication of overall strength and health of a company. In general if the stock prices continues to climb, the company is said to be growing.
- We analyze the stock prices and observe that if everyone is happy, especially the customers, there is a likelihood that the stock prices will increase or at least not decrease.
- This is where the integration of fundamental and technical analysis seems inevitable. Fundamental analysis takes the underlying causes in price shift into consideration and technical causes taking previous stock prices into consideration.



Project Objective

- Public mood on news/twitter about a company is representative of overall sentiment about the respective company.
- The overall sentiment about a company can have a direct or indirect impact on its stock prices. As a result, analyzing sentiments along with the traditional stock prices forecasting is a very important aspect.
- One of the biggest source of extracting public reaction to a company or its product or any stock price related variables are Twitter, Google trends, Reddit, etc. 
- Time series analysis is the most common and fundamental method used to perform this task. 
- Our project aims to combine the conventional time series analysis with news from Reddit to predict weekly changes in stock price.
